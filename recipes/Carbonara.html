    <h2 class="hcent">Spaghetti carbonara</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta thatâ€™s so creamy, youâ€™d swear thereâ€™s a good amount of cream in it. And indeed, thereâ€™s plenty of recipes that cheat by adding in cream.</p>
    <p>But today, weâ€™re making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional way. No cream. Just egg, cheese and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water.</p>
    <h3 class="hcent">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>guanciale</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>spaghetti</li>
        <li>parmigiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="hcent">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Batons - Cut the guanciale into thick batons. Biting through the golden brown crust into meaty bits of salty guanciale is part of the awesomeness that is carbonara!</li>
        <li>Sauce - Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta - Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through.

</li>
        <li>Reserve pasta cooking water - Just before draining, scoop out one cup of pasta cooking water. Then drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
        <li>Cook guanciale until golden while the pasta is cooking. You donâ€™t need any oil, the guanciale will fry in its own fat. </li>
        <li> Toss pasta in guanciale â€“ Tumble the hot pasta into the pan with the guanciale then toss so the pasta gets coated in the guanciale fat.</li>
        <li>Transfer into sauce bowl â€“ Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is gold! ðŸ™‚</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix vigorously with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch as the watery pale yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce.

You know itâ€™s ready when the sauce is no longer watery and pooled in the bottom of the bowl. Instead, it will be thickened, creamy, and clinging to the pasta!</li>
    </ol>
